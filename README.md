# Arduino-FreeRTOS-Logging-and-Metrics
Arduino-FreeRTOS-Logging-and-Metrics enables logging and real-time metrics collection for Arduino projects on FreeRTOS. Features networked log sending and system monitoring for events like temperature changes or button presses. Ideal for enhancing Arduino diagnostics and performance tracking.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- PIR Motion Sensor
- Push Button

Ensure your Arduino Uno R4 WiFi is connected to the sensors as follows:

- DHT11 sensor to digital pin [5]
- PIR sensor to digital pin [3]
- Push button to digital pin [4]
